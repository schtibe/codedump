I recently watched the movie [My Neighbour Totoro](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096283/)
What a wonderful movie!

On of the memorable scenes is of course the one on the bus stop. Probably the most famous shot is the one where Totoro stands
next to Mei and Satsuki. But before that, the camera moves to a view from above, pointing down so we can see
the street lamp and the red umbrella from above, with the rain pouring. I found that quite interesting:

It somehow also reminded me of this shot from the Matrix, which is similarly cool:
