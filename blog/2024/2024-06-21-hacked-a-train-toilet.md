What I love about this is that this person paid attention to their
surroundings. They tried to understand the most ordinary thing they encountered.
Yet this makes clear that even those things had to be designed by someone.
Somebody had to make an effort and figure out a system on how to lock a train
toilet. And this hack somewhat pays homage to that.
