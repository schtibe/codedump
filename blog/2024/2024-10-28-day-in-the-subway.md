[I Spent 24 Hours Straight On the NYC Subway!](https://annekadet.substack.com/i/149606208/i-spent-hours-straight-on-the-nyc-subway)

I have always been fascinated by big Cities, how everything there is layered and nested,
how it contains various little sub cities and spaces.
One such space is of course the underground and the subway. Anne Kadet decided
to spend an entire 24 hours in the subway of NCY. A fun read, takes one through
the sub world of the city while meeting various types of uplifting people.
