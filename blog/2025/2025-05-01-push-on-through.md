So many temptations, So many distractions
A belly full of sugar and a head full of captions
Trying to streamline my thoughts and actions
In a world where it all boils down to fractions
Trying to stray grounded and persevere
Trying to overcome my anger, overcome fear
Hoping that one day it will all become clear
But I'm still young and my work's not done here
